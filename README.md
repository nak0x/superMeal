# The SuperMeal

The superMeal, is a quick project for practicing native AJAX.

It use the meal db and I've tried to use as max a good practicies in Js as I can, such as "a function should have only one responsability", or "Do never use Ctrl+c Ctrl+v, and duplicated code"

See the online demo : [Github page](https://nak0x.github.io/superMeal/)
